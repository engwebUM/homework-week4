why applying a certain pattern is not better way.
Some examples are given bellow:

# Decorator Pattern
This pattern allow us to add behavior to objects in run time without affecting other objects of the same class. In this project not make sense apply this pattern because the all objects used not need additional responsabilities in run time.

# Observer Pattern
This pattern define a dependency one-to-many between objects, and when a object change the state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. We can used this pattern in this project for example, if we have some users that would like to know the score of the games, so when the score was changed, this users would be notified.

# Facade Pattern
This pattern provides a unified interface to a set of instances in a sub-system. Facade defines a higher level interface that makes the system easier to use. For this project not is the better way because not is complex enough to use this pattern.
